Login and registration system using Python Flask.

The user can create a username with a password and use the credentials to login.
After succesful login, the page shows all usernames registered.
Also, the project warns the user if an username is already registered and shows an error in case of a missing username/password or wrong password.

The goal of the project was to improve my knowledge of Flask and flask-sqlalchemy as the database.
Also, this project uses basic HTML5 and CSS3 since the frontend was not the focus.

VERSION OF WHAT WAS USED:
	Python - v3.10.0
	Flask - v2.2
	SQLAlchemy - v1.4.42
	HTML5 & CSS3
